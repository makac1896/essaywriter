    "mentorDescription": "I am a recent graduate of Harvard University where I obtained a bachelor's degree with High Honours in Chemistry with a sustained interest in both chemical theory and research. I also have a minor in Economics. I was born in Harare, Zimbabwe. My life's goal is to revolutionise healthcare and development in my home country Zimbabwe. I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Chemical Engineering from The University of Cambridge. I am passionate about Healthcare and Energy and I want to dedicate my life to building sustainable systems in both fields. I believe the future of healthcare in Africa is low-cost diagnostics! Every year millions of Africans go untreated because of severe under-diagnosis due to either cost or availability constraints of diagnostic tools. I want to change that. I want to acquire all the tools needed to start my own low-cost diagnostics company to span across the continent.",
