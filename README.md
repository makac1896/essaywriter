# Dave - Revolutionizing College Counseling for African Students

## Project Description

**Dave** is a custom WhatsApp-based solution designed to address the college counseling struggles faced by African students. In a region where access to college counseling services is often limited, Dave offers an easy-to-use, scalable, and entirely free platform. It empowers low-income students to access counseling and prepare effectively for college applications. At its core, Dave is a system crafted to guide students, regardless of their starting point, from novices in college research to experts in networking, essay writing, personal branding, and other skills essential for the college application journey. Dave is tailored for rural students, making it accessible via the ubiquitous messaging platform, WhatsApp. With Dave, students can receive world-class mentorship and connect with fellow African students who are either already enrolled at prestigious institutions or in the process of applying to colleges.

## Aim

By launching **Dave**, HIS Alumni aims to make a significant impact on the annual college application process for a substantial portion of the student population.

## Target Population

**Dave** caters primarily to rural/low-income undergraduate scholarship applicants and individuals seeking to enhance their writing skills.

## Key Features

### 1. Resource Dissemination
   - **Dave** boasts access to an extensive database of resources, offering students access to documents such as admissions officers' notes from Ivy League universities, personal anecdotes from students at MIT, Harvard, Princeton, and more. It also provides guides for applying for financial aid, including applications specific to supported schools.

### 2. Match
   - The **Match** feature empowers students to submit essays anonymously and receive feedback from a trained AI model. But it doesn't stop there; it goes further by employing a powerful matching algorithm. This algorithm assesses each student's essay and carefully pairs them with at least three mentors who are exceptionally suited to assist based on shared interests, expertise, and various other attributes. These mentors possess a wealth of experience in the college application process and are aligned to provide guidance tailored to each student's unique needs.

### 3. Personalized Learning Plans
   - **Dave** allows students to submit a 'mock' essay where they can introduce themselves, express their interests, and identify areas where they require assistance. This diagnostic essay aids **Dave** in assessing a student's writing level, familiarity with the college application process, and other essential metrics. Subsequently, **Dave** designs personalized learning plans encompassing resources, mentorship, and writing strategies to guide students through the college application cycle.

### 4. Connect
   - **Connect** facilitates direct interactions between students and representatives from supported schools. Students can freely pose questions, share experiences, and network with current students at their dream institutions. This feature not only connects students with mentors but also integrates with **Dave's Blog System** to generate weekly reports highlighting popular questions and responses. This invaluable resource allows us to identify areas where students need the most assistance.

### 5. Iris
   - Imagine "Iris" as the watchful eye of **Dave**, inspired by the biological iris in your eye. **Iris** is an analytical feature that assesses all essays submitted to **Dave**. It provides comprehensive reports pinpointing common errors, thematic issues, and structural concerns. **Iris's** in-depth analysis enhances **Dave's** ability to offer precise and tailored feedback, aiding mentors, college counselors, and partner organizations in understanding applicant struggles better.

### 6. Cloud Functionality
   - **Dave** offers cloud functionality, allowing for real-time, anonymous collaboration among multiple mentors to provide student feedback. This collaborative approach streamlines the essay review process, saving mentors time and simplifying the viewing, tracking, and sharing of insights within the **Dave** community.
