It is created by analyzing the student's interactions and engagements with Dave. This report provides depth insights into the student's writing level, strengths, and areas that need improvement.</p>
        
                    <p>Please feel free to provide your feedback directly on this <a href="${documentURL}">document</a> or, if you prefer, you can share your thoughts directly with the student at <b>${phoneNumber}</b>.</p>
        
                    <p>As you prepare to provide feedback, I'd like to share a few general practices that can help ensure you offer the best guidance to our students:</p>

                        <li><b>Clarity and Conciseness:</b> Review the essay for clarity and conciseness. Help students refine their ideas to ensure that their message is clear and easy to understand.</li>
        
                        <li><b>Engaging Introduction:</b> Discuss the importance of a captivating introduction that draws the reader in. Suggest strategies for starting the essay with an engaging hook.</li>
        
                        <li><b>Show, Don't Tell:</b> Advise students to use vivid and descriptive language to illustrate their experiences and qualities. Encourage them to provide specific examples that showcase their attributes.</li>
        
                        <li><b>Reflect on Growth:</b> Help students reflect on personal growth or lessons learned from their experiences. Emphasize the importance of self-reflection in making the essay meaningful.</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <p>Thank you so much for your ongoing support and dedication to our students' success. Your mentorship continues to make a positive impact, and we are truly grateful to have you as a part of our team.</p>
